    <h1>Industry Data</h1>
        
      <p>
          In Canvas on the Assignment 2 page, you will find a link to some industry data supplied by Burning Glass. You should use this (as well as any other data you may be able to find) to answer the following questions. If you’re to be looking outside of the IT field, find similar data for your specific Industry.

        <ul>
            <li><strong> What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers? </li></strong>
        
        <p>
            The job titles of our group’s jobs are Investment Analyst, Digital Analytics Specialist, Application Architect, Database Administrator, Software engineer, IT consultant respectively. <br>
            According to Burning glass data, whose service involves artificial intelligence match peoples’ resumes with job postings, the ranking in terms of demand from employers over 3 years is as follows:

            From your group's ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs (we will refer to this as your group's required skill set). These can be divided into general skills (communication, problem solving, writing etc) and IT-specific skills (Javascript, SQL, etc).

<li><strong>
    What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?
    </li></strong>

<p> As mentioned above, the IT specific skill set of the group is pretty much what is in demand. However, there were some skills which appeared in the list but not in our skill set. Those were:
</p>

<ol> <li> <u> Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning
    </li> </u>
<p> IT skills in Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning make one of the most demanding and best jobs in the world.
</p>

<li> <u> Security </li> </u> 
<p> Familiarity with network and software security, data encryption, knowledge of compliance regulations and standards such as HIPAA, CCPA and PCI-DSS is one of the most demanding jobs.
</p>

<li> <u> Machine learning </li> </u> </ol>
<p> It is a subset of Artificial Intelligence and is quite useful for programmers and data professionals. It has also come out to be the most prominent skills to learn in the technology sphere.
</p>

<li> What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?
</li> </ol>

<p> The three highest ranked general skills which were not in our required skill set were found to be:
</p>

<ol type = "I">
    <li> <u> Analytical abilities 
        </li></u>
<p> You are required to find logical solutions to problems quite often, so, analytical abilities allow you to diagnose technology issues and fix them. Having this ability provides a major edge when you look for IT careers.
</p>


<li><u> Resourcefulness 
    </li></u>
<p>
    This skill elucidates the ability to derive software, technology and products that embrace their own productivity. A resourceful mind who uses resources effectively and efficiently tends to always stand out in whatever they do.
</p>

<li><u> Confidence </li> </u> </ol>

<p> One must always have confidence and faith in themselves, their colleagues and the company they’re working for. Striking a healthy balance between being confident, over confident and arrogant is quite essential as well.
</p>
<br>
<strong>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?
 </strong>

<p> Having looked and studied the Burning Glass data, we feel that the ideal jobs we have and the skill set required for them are mostly right on track. 
However the jobs in our list who are not as demanding as the others can be considered to other subfields like Artificial Intelligence. This way, we can get our effective set of jobs that are actually demanded in the market.
